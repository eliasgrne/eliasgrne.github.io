    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I’m Elias Greene. I am a Computer Science student at North Carolina A&T State University
        with a focus on software, data, and product-driven problem solving. I care about building technology that empowers communities, increases access, and creates pathways for the next generation of Black men in tech.
        Outside the classroom, I am involved in leadership, service, and campus initiatives that connect students to resources, mentorship, and professional development.
