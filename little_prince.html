        As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
        <span class="u">I felt deeply moved, and stirred.</span>
        It seemed to me that I was
        <span class="u">carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
        <span class="hl">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
        In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
        said to myself: <span class="red">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
        <br>
        As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
        <span class="red">
          "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower—the image of a rose
          that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."
        </span>
        And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be
        extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .
